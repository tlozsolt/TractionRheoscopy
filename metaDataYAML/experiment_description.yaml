      This is glass/crystal composite that is sheared. There is a pre-shear imaging
      stack and two shears a-b.
      Not clear to me what the difference is between the shearRuns a and b, perhaps
      there was a problem with shearing. This should be apparent from the notes during
      shear.Or perhaps the number of cycles or imaging parameters are different.

      Also polycrystalline. Looks clean as well. 1024 pixels. THere are few
      postShear imaging stacks as well. Shear steps a-i
      There is also sedimentation time laps and darkFrameTimeSeries on camera 2922
      There is some dense probably 5um silica that was injected from the top that by
      shearRun11062019g (possibly a different location than shearRun 05062019), 
      has started to sink through the grid. The polyrcrystal has large domains spanning
      nearly 200um field of view near the gel, but very fine polycrystalline grains about
      halfway up and through the sample.

    I tried to get shear induced order in a quote old TFR gel sample. 
    I was out of some of the supplies like TEM grid and a few things went
    wrong in the experiment as documented in the notes.txt file in the
